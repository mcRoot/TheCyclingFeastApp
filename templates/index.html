            <h1 class="text-white mb-4">The Cycling Feast</h1>
            <p class="text-white-50">
              <b>Road cycling</b> and <b>mountain biking</b> have been steadily growing in popularity in recent years due to the
              beneficial effects on health and well-being. This has been fueling an increasing interest in services for amateur riders, ranging from
              professional training programs, "cycling feasts" as well as travel-agency services and bike and component manufactures.
              Getting data to help highlight the trend of <i>"novel recruits"</i> can be fundamental to refine the aforementioned services
              and provide a better target for business.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white-50">
              Among the others, <a href="http://strava.com/" target="_blank">Strava</a>, dubbed as <i>"The Social Network of Athletes"</i> is by far the most
              well-regarded Web and mobile platform adopted by cyclists to track their activities.
              Since its start in 2009, both recreational and professional cyclists have been increasingly used the service to upload their activities
              and connect (or follow) others. One of the most peculiar features is that of <b>segments</b>: users can create public segments, custom road/off-road
              paths (corresponding to roads and trails in the real world) where community members can compete to obtain the best time and become the
              KOM (King of the Mountain) or QOM (Queen of the Mountain).
            </p>
            <p class="text-white-50">
              Though most of the data is (reasonably) kept strictly private, data related to segment attempts is publicly available (in an anonymized form)
              via <i>Strava REST API</i>, allowing in principle to infer trends on the popularity of cycling as a recreational sport among people.
              More specifically, we exploited the API to download the details of more than 8.000 hill and mountain climbs located in Italy: we chose Italy
              because of its "reputation" as a region of cyclists, furthermore we focused just on <i>climbs</i> as <i>those represent both a dream and a fear
              for any amateur and, among the others, one of the reasons for a fan of cycling and/or mountain biking to ride her bike.</i>

              Additionally, as can be intuitively seen in the image below
            </p>
              <p><img class="tcf-opacity-90" src="/static/img/italy-land.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""></p>
            <p class="text-white-50">
              Italy is mostly hills and mountains, precisely <i>hills and mountains account for around <b>80%</b> of the whole Italy's territory</i>, as such we can safely state that
              climbs alone, beyond being very popular among cyclists, give quite a representative sample of "geographical riding habits" in Italy.

              So that is why, in the end, we believe that climbs can be a good starting point to depict a representative trend of the whole amateur cycling community.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white-50">
              Along with section details, such as average grade, length, elevation difference and so far, we downloaded also details of any single attempt on these segments in the time frame 2009-2017:
              preliminary data analysis showed a pretty clear growing trend of new bike riders over recent years and a strong correlation between turistic locations and
              concentration of rides. Also, time of the year and day of the week represent good indicators to discover popularity of a particular place among cyclists.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white-50">
             The ultimate goal of the project is to leverage machine learning techniques to devise regression models able to predict the trend (the amount) of bike rides is specific locations,
              as base brick to <b>develop an application to suggest the best places in Italy for cycling fans to go riding</b>.

            <h1 class="text-white mb-4">The Project</h1>
              <p class="text-white-50">
              Here we present and discuss every detail related to the project, from the dataset exploited to the analysis performed in order to develop the predictive model exploited in the actual application.
              </p>
            <h2 class="text-white mb-4">The Dataset</h2>
            <p class="text-white-50">
              The dataset has been generated via exploitation of the <a href="https://strava.github.io/api/v3/" target="_blank">Strava REST API</a>.
            <br/><br/>
               We focused on <i>Segments</i> data structure in order to explore and gather the data of public segments located in Italy along with the corresponding <i>efforts</i>:
               this data is publicly available once you register on Strava since does not contain sensitive information about platform' users.
                In particular, we used these REST endpoint:
                <ul class="text-white-50">
                 <li><a href="https://strava.github.io/api/v3/segments/#explore">segment explorer</a>, in order to scan the geographical area of interest for relevant segments;
                 </li>
                 <li><a href="https://strava.github.io/api/v3/segments/#efforts">list efforts</a> so as to collect the comprehensive list of efforts for every segment previously collected via the segment explorer endpoint.
                 </li>
               </ul>
              <br/><br/>
              <span class="text-white-50">
              We limited the scope of the search to <i>climb segments</i> as hills and mountains can be a well representative sample of road cyclists and mountain bikers' behavior in Italy.
              Data as been collected using <i>Python</i>, exploiting <i>requests</i> module and leveraging the flexibility of <i>Pandas</i> so as to arrange the dataset in csv files.
            The resulting files and their corresponding content is described in the following sections.</span>
            </p>
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-white mb-4">Segments</h3>
          <p class="text-white-50">
            Segments are road paths created by Strava users that can be shared with other members: riders can virtually "compete"
          on these segments to complete them in the shortest time possible. Segments' data can be found at
          <a href="https://github.com/mcRoot/thecyclingfeast/blob/master/dataset/strava_segments_italy_DEF.csv" target="_blank">strava_segments_italy.csv</a>.
            <br/>
            The file contains the details of around <i>6000</i> "climb" segments located in Italy covering mostly the Appennines the Alps.
            For each segment, a record is provided, showing several features:
            <ul class="text-white-50">
            <li>a <i>unique integer id</i> of the segment;</li>
             <li>the <i>name</i> of the segment (e.g. Mont Blanc climb);</li>
            <li>the <i>average grade</i>;</li>
             <li>the <i>climb category</i>, from 1 (easiest) to 5 (the so called "horse categorie");</li>
            <li>the <i>total distance</i> in meters;</li>
             <li>the <i>elevation difference</i> in meters;</li>
            <li>the data related to <i>start</i> and <i>end latitude</i> and <i>longitude</i>.</li>
           </ul>
          </p>
            <h3 class="text-white mb-4">Efforts</h3>
          <p class="text-white-50">
            The data related to efforts is organized in a series of csv files, containing the details of around <i>6,000,000</i> different efforts on the <i>6000</i>
            climbs downloaded. An <i>effort</i> corresponds to a unique attempt at completing a segment by an athlete. The downloaded efforts correspond to rides made mostly
            in the period from 2009 - December 2017, though, due to data errors, there are more than <i>200</i> activities featuring unlikely years, either way too in the past
            (1970) or in the future (2019 and further!): this is probably caused by wrong datetime setup on bike computers or smartphones used by athletes
            to upload their activities.
            <br/><br/>
            Some or the relevant data for each effort:
            <ul class="text-white-50">
            <li>the anonymized <i>athlete name</i> (only first name displayed);</li>
            <li>the <i>start date</i> in GMT timezone along with the <i>start date</i> in <i>local</i> timezone;</li>
            <li>the <i>elapsed time</i> (in seconds), i.e. the total time spent on the segment since start datetime;</li>
             <li>the <i>moving time</i> (in seconds), i.e. the total time the rider was actually pedalling (this time is usually equal or less than elapsed time);</li>
            <li>the <i>rank</i>, i.e. the position of the effort on the leaderboard, based on elapsed time, where 1 means KOM/QOM (King of the Mountain/Queen of the Mountain).</li>
           </ul>
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Analysis</h2>
            <p class="text-white-50">
                We initially analyzed how amateur cycling has been evolving in Italy over the last years, selecting the period <i>2009-2017</i> as a reference <i>time frame</i>.
            </p>
          <h3 class="text-white mb-4">Number of Kilometers Ridden</h3>
            <p class="text-white-50">
                First of all, we focussed on the total number of kilometers ridden by Strava's users over the reference period.
            </p>
              <p><img class="tcf-opacity-90" src="/static/img/prj/km-ridden.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""></p>
              <p class="text-white-50">
                  As we can see, the growth has been sort of exponential: in particular, focusing on the most recent years (2015-2017), the number of kilometers traveled doubled from 1.5 millions to almost 4 millions.
              <br/><br/>
                  Of course, we are aware that this exponential trend can suffer from a "technological bias" caused by an increased availability of gps-enabled devices (bike computers, smartphone)
                  that have made it possible to ease the recording of sport activities on online services such as Strava.
                  In other words, while in 2009 the number of such Internet-ready devices was low, their availability was with no doubt much higher in 2015-2017, leading to a possible "technological bias" in the figures.
                  <br/>
                  However, even though the number and the availability of such devices in 2009 may even have been quite low, starting from 2015, we have witnessed a relative large diffusion and availability of Internet-enabled devices, so that we can assume no "technological bias" affecting the data from 2015 on.
             <br/><br/>
              A better measure would perhaps be distance traveled per year <i>normalized by total number of users registered to the platform in a given year</i>: unfortunately Strava does not disclose this information.
              </p>

            <h3 class="text-white mb-4">Geolocated Number of Training Sessions</h3>
            <p class="text-white-50">
                Next, we analyzed the number of training sessions (efforts) per segment, geolocated on a map, so as to define a preliminary spatial correlation between users' efforts and segments where the rides took place.
            </p>
              <p><img class="tcf-opacity-90" src="/static/img/prj/effort-geolocated.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""></p>
              <div class="text-white-50">
                  <span class="text-white-50">The chart above shows the geolocated count of segment efforts in four different years taken as reference:</span>
                  <br/>
                  <ul class="text-white-50">
                    <li>2009, selected as the year of the official kickoff of Strava, so that we going to regard efforts' quantities on this year as a sort of baseline for subsequent years.</li>
                    <li>2013, as we can suppose that the availability of gps-enabled sport devices was large enough so as to represent no technological barrier to athletes to access online services such as Strava.</li>
                    <li>Finally, 2015 and 2017 represent the very recent past allowing to understand what kind of growth in the amateur cyclist community one can expected over a shorter timespan (2 years).</li>
                  </ul>
              <span class="text-white-50">Geolocalization on the map was devised by taking start latitude and longitude of each segment and plotting a dot in the corresponding point in the map. As we come closer to 2017, we can see that the number of dots increases (do not take color into account for now): that accounts for the effect of new segments added by users that very same year, in other words segments not available previously. As a consequence, just by looking at the density of dots, we can realized that, while the earlier years 2009 and 2013 witnessed a remarkable growth in the number of segments added to Strava, in 2015 and 2017 the number of new segments reached a "plateau": indeed, looking at 2013 versus 2015 and 2015 versus 2017, it is hard to spot a growth in dots' density. This effect is with no doubt due also to the fact that once a mountain or hill pass got covered by someone who created a segment and publicly shared it, there is no longer need to create a new segment for it. This also tells us that in the space of few years the whole Italy got completely covered on Strava.
              </span><br/><br/>
              <span class="text-white-50">The most interesting data, anyway, lies in the color of dots: lighter ones denote a higher number of efforts made on them in the given year. Looking at the evolution depicted in the map it is easy to recognize a strongly growing trend that, we think, can be regarded as a good candidate predictor of the trend in coming years. Indeed, since technology (gps and Internet-enabled bike devices) does not represent anymore a barrier for people to join communities like Strava and, consequently, cannot be regarded as a bias on the data, we expect the coming years being revelatory for such a trend and, ultimately, a good reason to further investigate and analyse.
              </span></div>

              <h3 class="text-white mb-4">Distribution of Rides by Month</h3>
            <p class="text-white-50">
                Let's analyze now how users' rides are distributed over the different months of the year: the chart below shows the distribution of rides by month on the whole dataset, considering the time frame 2009-2017.</p>
              <p><img class="tcf-opacity-90" src="/static/img/prj/effort-month.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""></p>
              <div class="text-white-50">
                  It is sort of easy to recognize that most of the rides in Italy occurs during <i>summertime</i> (June - August) with a peak in July. Also, riders seems to be quite active during <i>late Spring</i> (May) and <i>early Fall</i>.
                  <br/><br/>
                   This is as well quite understandable as Italy is located in <i>temperate zone</i>. It also proves, as we were expecting, that climate has a strong influence on riders' habits: along this path, future correlations with historical weather records would be helpful in devising accurate predictive models.

              <h3 class="text-white mb-4">Distribution of Rides by Day of Week</h3>
            <p class="text-white-50">
                Let's analyse now riders' habits over the week by looking at the way rides are distributed among days of week. Again, the chart below shows the distribution of rides by day of week considering the whole dataset.</p>
              <p><img class="tcf-opacity-90" src="/static/img/prj/effort-dow.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""></p>
              <div class="text-white-50">
                  Again, it should come as no surprise that most of the <i>riders</i> active on Strava <i>focus their rides in the weekend</i>, most notably on Sunday: accordingly, day of week can be regarded as a relevant predictor of the number of future rides.
              </div>
              <p></p>
              <h3 class="text-white mb-4">Distribution of Rides by Geographical Area</h3>
            <p class="text-white-50">
               Additionally, in order to see how a specific geographical area might affect the number of rides, we analyzed the density of rides in the different italian districts over the usual 2009-2017 period.
               <br/>
                In order to do so we exploited <a href="https://www.carto.com" target="_blank">Carto</a>, an online, "location intelligence" app.
              <p><img class="tcf-opacity-90" src="/static/img/prj/effort-latlon.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""></p>
              <div class="text-white-50">
                  A few patterns can be notices from the above geo-localized plot.
                  <br/><br/>
                  First of all, amateur cyclists seem to be more active in North/Central Italy, with the notable exception of east Sicily.
                  <br/>
                  Moreover, The Alps, and expecially Dolomites (Northmost region of Italy), show a stunning density of rides: this could be for instance explained by the fact that Dolomites are one of the UNESCO's world heritage sites, visited every year by hundreds of thousands of people from all around the World.
                  <br/>
                  The same can apply also to Tuscany and the renowned "Cinque Terre" that both show a very high density of rides.
                  <br/><br/>
                  In the end, we believe that geographical location of Strava's segments (latitude/longitude) plays also a strong role in predicting future number of rides.
              </div>
              <p></p>
              <h3 class="text-white mb-4">Influence of Accommodation Facilites</h3>
            <p class="text-white-50">
               Does the number of hotels in a particular area have an effect on how many rides occur on road segments located there? We decided to look at the number of hotels as a reference measure to rate how popular an area is for visitors and represent its capability of hosting potential bike riders.
               <br/><br/>
               In order to do so, we downloaded a publicly available dataset containing a well-representative list of hotels in Italy along with their corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates.
                The dataset was downloaded from <a href="http://www.datiopen.it/en/opendata/Mappa_degli_hotel_in_Italia" target="_blank">DatiOpen.it</a>, one of the largest italian initiatives on Open Data.
               <br/>
                Initially, we investigated the geographical density of rides correlated with the quantity of hotels in specific areas as shown in the image below.
                <p><img class="tcf-opacity-90" src="/static/img/prj/effort-hotel.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""></p>
              <div class="text-white-50">
                The heatmap represents the density of rides in the period 2009-2017, with increasing density levels from green to red: the pattern in this case is of course the same as the one displayed in previous image.
                Orange clusters show instead the number of hotels in a given area, making it possible to devise a first simple (but effective) correlation between accommodations and "ride propensity" on different areas in Italy.
                As we can see, in general, areas with higher ride densities also feature higher concentrations of hotels, showing that hotels can be adopted as an additional feature to build an effective predictive model.
                 <br/><br/>
                  Then, we leveraged one of KMeans clustering implementations provided by Scikit-learn (<a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.BallTree.html#sklearn.neighbors.BallTree" target="_blank">BallTree</a>) adopting a distance function relying on geodesic distance (via <a href="https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Geopy</a> library),
                  so as to obtain for each Strava segment a set of statistical values:
                  <ul class="text-white-50">
                      <li>the nearest 100 hotels;</li>
                      <li>the average distance of those hotels from the segment;</li><
                      li>the corresponding standard deviation, median, 25 and 75 percentile values;</li>
                      <li>the number hotels within a 30-km radius.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <span class="text-white-50">These values were also used later as features for engineering the dataset for the machine-learning model.</span>
              </div>
              <p></p>
              <h3 class="text-white mb-4">Additional Charts</h3>
              <p class="text-white-50">
                  In the following, a chart showing the distribution of number of rides as a function of segment's average distance from closest (nearest 100) hotels, is presented:
              </p>
              <p><img class="tcf-opacity-90" src="/static/img/prj/effort-hoteldistance.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""></p>
              <div class="text-white-50">
              It can be clearly seen that most of the rides tend to take place in segments with an average distance from nearby hotels between 16 and 46 km.
              </div>
              <p></p>
              <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Machine Learning</h2>
               <p class="text-white-50">
                   The main goal of the project was to develop a regression model able to predict the number of rides occurring in a specific Strava segment at a given future time.
                   In order to do so, we relied on machine-learning-based approach.
                   The problem faced here was a typical <i>regression problem</i> where the target is represented by <b>number of rides</b>.
                   Additionally, it is worth noting that time plays an important role since we aim at predicting future values: as such it is essential to introduce validation techniques similar to those adopted in time-series analysis.
                   <br/>
                   The most important stage of our work was related to feature engineering since designing good features is a key activity for implementing accurate models.
               </p>
              <p></p>
              <h3 class="text-white mb-4">Feature Engineering</h3>
               <p class="text-white-50">
                   In order to devise an effective set of feature to feed the predictive model at hand, we leveraged the analysis shown previously, resulting in the set of features described below.
               </p>
                <h4 class="text-white mb-4">Month and Day of Week</h4>
                <p class="text-white-50">
                   These features were included in the set of features since seasonality clearly plays a fundamental role in recreational cyclists' habits: as shown above, indeed, mid seasons and summer are the part of the year where most of the rides tend to occur.
                   Also, weekend is clearly preferred over regural workdays.
                   <br/>
                   Both the features are to be intended as categorical.
               </p>
                <h4 class="text-white mb-4">Years since Strava Kickoff</h4>
                <p class="text-white-50">
                   We have seen previously that Strava has witnessed an exponential growth in terms of number of rides (km ridden) since its kickoff in 2009: this can be regarded as a true drift we need to be taken into account.
                   <br/>
                   To this end, when trying to predict how many rides will occur on a specific segment in a particular day on a given month, we are also going to consider how many years has passed since Strava openings.
                   In order to do so we can simply take the year and subtract 2009 (the year Strava was launched): accordingly, if we want to predict the number of rides occurring on a segment in the Sundays of August 2019, "years since kickoff" is going to have a value of 10.
               </p>
                <h4 class="text-white mb-4">Geographical Location of Segments</h4>
                <p class="text-white-50">
                   As seen during analysis, location of Strava segments is a good predictor for assessing the trend of rides on those, as such, we decided to include in the set of features each segment's <i>start latitude and longitude</i>.
               </p>
                <h4 class="text-white mb-4">Hotels</h4>
                <p class="text-white-50">
                   The availability of accommodation structures is also a factor affecting segments' appeal. Accordingly, we exploited the dataset on Italy's hotels and, for each segment, devised the following set of features:
                    <ul class="text-white-50">
                      <li>the nearest 100 hotels;</li>
                      <li>the average distance of those hotels from the segment;</li>
                      <li>the corresponding standard deviation, median, 25 and 75 percentile values;</li>
                      <li>the number hotels within a 30-km radius.</li>
                    </ul>
               </p>
               <h4 class="text-white mb-4">Summing up</h4>
                <p class="text-white-50">
                   As a result of feature engineering process, the machine-learning-ready data is composed so as to feature, for each segment, several samples: specifically, one for each day of the week of every month for each of the years from 2009 to 2017 (these are represented in terms of "years passed since Strava launch").
                   <br/>
                    Furthermore, for each sample, reference latitude and longitude, as well as statistical values regarding hotels, are also specified as additional features.
               </p>
               <h3 class="text-white mb-4">Designing a Regression Model</h3>
               <p class="text-white-50">
                   Well-established machine learning techniques were adopted to devise a predictive model of the number of rides.
                   <br/>
                   The model was developed on <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/" target="_blank">Scikit-learn</a> via exploitation of <b>esemble techniques</b> resulting in a combination of two regressors in sequence:
                   <ul class="text-white-50">
                    <li>a <b>linear regressor</b> built with a <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html" target="_blank">Ridge</a> model;</li>
                    <li>a <b>random-forest regressor</b> (<a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html" target="_blank">RandomForestRegressor</a>) fit on the residuals (errors) resulting from fitting the linear model.</li>
                    </ul>
               </p>
               <h4 class="text-white mb-4">Train/Test Set and Validation</h4>
               <p class="text-white-50">
                   As time plays a key role in predicting number of rides, the full dataset was spit in a train and a test set by relying on an approach typical of time-series analysis: all the samples referring to the period 2009-2016 were included in the train set, while the remaining samples regarding year 2017 went to form the test set:
                   accordingly, the number of samples in the resulting training set was <b>485,567</b>, while the test set resulted in <b>201,057</b> samples.
                   <br>
                   In fact, given the strong temporal nature of the data, preserving the order of samples is fundamental when splitting the dataset.
                   <br><br>
                   As far as validation is concerned, the model was cross-validated adopting a well-established time-series-analysis techniques called <b>forward chaining</b>, which is provided by Scikit-learn in <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html" target="_blank">TimeSeriesSplit</a>.
                   <br>
                   By relying on TimeSeriesSplit, cross-validation was then performed by considering <b>3 splits</b> and adopting <b>grid search</b> (<a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html" target="_blank">GridSearchCV</a> on Scikit-learn) to investigate the most-effective set of hyperparameters.
                   <br><br>
                   The aforementioned cross-validation process resulted in the following hyperparameter values:
                    <ul class="text-white-50">
              <li>A regularization hyperparameter <b>alpha</b> equal to <b>0.001</b> on the ridge linear model.</li>
                    <li>As far as random forest is concerned, the following values were instead found:</li>
              <ul class="text-white-50">
                  <li><b>max features</b> = <b>0.6</b></li>
                  <li><b>number of decision trees in the ensemble</b> = <b>40</b></li>
              </ul>
                    </ul>
               </p>
              <h4 class="text-white mb-4">Results</h4>
               <p class="text-white-50">
                   Predicting on the test set, the model achieved the following scores:
              <ul class="text-white-50">
                  <li>an <b>R<sup>2</sup> score</b> or <b>coefficient of determination</b> equal to  a <b>0.67</b> level of explained variance.</li>
                  <li>A <b>mean absolute error</b>  corresponding to <b>4.3</b> rides.</li>
              </ul>
               <p class="text-white-50">
              The following picture depicts the values predicted by model on (part) of the test set (green line) where blue dots represent instead actual number of rides.
               </p><p class="text-white-50"><img class="tcf-opacity-10" style="width:60%;" src="/static/img/prj/model-prediction.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
               </p>
              <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Designing the Actual Application</h2>
               <p class="text-white-50">
                   Starting from the regressor model devised, the aim of the project was to build an application to help amateur riders find the most popular places to ride in Italy, according to the period of the year they intend to visit a specific region.
                   <br>
                   In order to do so, we developed <a href="#app" target="_blank">The Cycling Feast Application</a> as an interactive map where the user can specify the month and the year she intends to ride in Italy; then, clicking on a particular italian region, the underlying regressor model will make predictions on a dataset structured in this way:
                   for each Strava segment in the region a sample is created for each day of the week (for a total of 7 samples per segment), adopting the selected month as the value for the month feature and calculating the value of "years since kickoff" accordingly to the year chosen by the user.
                   <br>
                   The resulting dataset sent to regressor for prediction has a size corresponding to <b>#segments in the region x 7</b>.
                   <br>
                   The predicted values are then analyzed via a Kernel Density Estimation so as to build a heatmap of ride density in the region. Additionally, the 10 segments featuring the highest number of total rides predicted are shown on the map, so as to help the user decide where to ride.
                   Also, clicking on each "best segment" shows additional details such as, for instance, the predicted distribution of rides over the different days of the week.
               </p>
              <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Future Work</h2>
               <p class="text-white-50">
                   Where are we going to go from here? This remains indeed a very preliminary work with several further analyses and improvements to be made.
                   <br>
                   A first improvement would be of course that of expanding the number of segments to account for as well as to further investigate feature engineering.
                   This could involve exploiting new data, for instance data reporting historical weather conditions in Italy.
                   <br>
                   Then, in order to keep the model always up to date, we will introduce <b>online learning</b> so as to fit the model also on latest rides recorded on Strava.
